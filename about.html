   <h2> Memories</h2>

   <p id="para"> Memoroes, like wisps of smoke,<br>
    Drifting in and out of mind, <br>
    Some are bright and clear as day<br>
    Othhers faded, harh to find. <br>  
    <br>
    Memoriesof layghter and joy,<br>
    Of love that felt so true <br>
    Of moments that we shared with those,<br>
    Whom we bid a fond adieu. <br>
    <br>
    Memories of stuggle and pain,<br>
     Of tears we shed alone, <br>
    Of hardships that we overcome,<br> 
     To make our hearts a home. <br>
      <br>
    Memories of chidhood days, <br> 
    Of innocence and wonder, <br>
    Of dreams that we held in our hearts,<br> 
    And stories that we spun with thunder. <br> 
     <br>
    Memories, they shape our lives, <br> 
    In ways we cannot measure, <br>
    They're woven into our very souls, <br> 
    A treasure we'll always treasure.
