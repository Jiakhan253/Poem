      <p> A few leaves stay for a while on the trees <br>
        After their color begins to turn, <br>
        And no other Leaves Seems as gold as these <br>
        Not enen the ones our bonfires burn <br>
        With golden flames in piles on the ground. <br>
        A few leaves stay so long that i found <br>
        The one last leaf on a tree in the snow, <br> 
        And when a galloping wind came round <br>
        The edge of our house and started to blow <br> 
        Snow dust to sparkles floating free. <br>
        When the mind ran away , almost with me, <br>
        And sunshine settled quiet and cold. <br>
        There, like a bird, still on the tree <br> 
        Was that lonesome leaf, no longer gold <br>
        But curly and brown and dry and old. <br> <br>
